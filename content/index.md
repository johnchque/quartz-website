title: About these notes

Hi!

I'm John Choque and you stumbled upon my digital garden. Let me give you a bit of context.

My passions come from the goal of ensuring that everyone is treated fairly. In this way, my work falls into the categories of ed-tech, mental health advocacy, social sustainability, open source software, knowledge management, and computer ethics.

This website is a recollection of my writing and notes. I do believe in the open knowledge principles and I try to create my own corner on the Internet. At the moment, there is no index or navigation aids. A good starting point is to check [[thoughts/whats-top-of-mind|Â§What's top of mind]].

If you want to work with me, talk, or just know more about me feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/johnchque" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/johnchque" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, or my <a href="https://www.johnchque.com">main personal webiste</a>.
