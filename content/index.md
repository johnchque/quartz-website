Hi!

I'm John Choque and you stumbled upon my digital garden. Let me give you a bit of context.

The core of my work lies somewhere between social entrepreneurship, programming and philosophy. The combination of these fields has allowed me to explore multiple areas of knowledge that I would never have thought to explore otherwise.

My passions come from the goal of ensuring that everyone is treated fairly. In this way, my work falls into the categories of ed-tech, mental health advocacy, social sustainability, open source software, knowledge management, and computer ethics.

If you want to know more about me, check [[about|this page]]

This website is a recollection of my writing and notes. I do believe in the open knowledge principles and I try to create my own corner on the Internet. At the moment, there is no index or navigation aids beyond the about pages. A good starting point is to check what's top of mind.

This page also has an index of my [[projects]], and my [[portfolio]].

If you want to work with me, feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/johnchque" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/johnchque" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.
