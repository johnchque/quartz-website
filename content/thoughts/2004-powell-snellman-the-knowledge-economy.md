The broad label "knowledge economy" covers a wide array of activities and
 interpretations. At least three lines of research fall under this umbrella.
1. New science-based industries and their role in social and economic change. Theoretical knowledge is a source of innovation.
2. Analysing how much knowledge-intensive industries contribute to growth in productivity.
3. Role of learning and continuous innovation inside firms.

Knowledge economy: the production and services based on  knowledge-intensive activities that contribute to an accelerated pace of technological and scientific advance as well as equally rapid obsolescence.
