*TEDxUCB 2019 Team*

TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = an independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance, rules and regulations for the TEDx program.

During my time in TEDxUCB I was able to express myself more artistically. Being able to work with the speakers helped me understand their human side and by the work we did together at TEDxUCB our main task was to share this human aspect with all the participants of the event. It was an awesome experience that made me expand my network and show my artistic skills.
