IAESTE is a worldwide organization that facilitates international exchange programs for students in the fields of science, engineering, technology, and applied arts. IAESTE provides opportunities for students to gain practical work experience in their chosen fields by arranging internships or traineeships abroad.

Since January 2019, I volunteer to the organization as the Commitee Leader in La Paz in Bolivia. In charge of giving talks about the program to all local universitites, guide foreign students when they arrive my country and support applicants when needed.
