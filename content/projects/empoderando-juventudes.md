Empoderando Juventudes (Empowering Youth) is an organisation with the firm conviction of encouraging Latin American youth to actively and cooperatively fight for peace, equality and social and environmental justice in our communities and our region through projects, activities where knowledge, skills, dreams and struggles are combined and strengthened.

My time with Empoderando Juventudes helped me to understand the importance of social impact at a local level. Working with other motivated people who wanted to raise awareness among the population and learn more about the environmental crisis we are going through. It was definitely an amazing experience that would contribute to the betterment of our society.
