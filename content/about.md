Social entrepreneur and programmer.

## A Little Context

The core of my work lies somewhere between social entrepreneurship, programming and philosophy. The combination of these fields has allowed me to explore multiple areas of knowledge that I would never have thought to explore otherwise.

My passions come from the goal of ensuring that everyone is treated fairly. In this way, my work falls into the categories of ed-tech, mental health advocacy, social sustainability, open source software, knowledge management, and computer ethics.

I did a Master's in <a href="https://dclead.eu/" target="_blank">Digital Communication Leadership</a> at Aalborg University in Denmark. My thesis aimed to understand the ethics behind algorithms and what are the implications of such matters in society.

I also currently collaborate with <a href="https://www.openschoolsolutions.com/" target="_blank">OPENschool</a> by developing their platform. OPENschool is an organization that aims to change the ways how things work within the classroom by giving more freedom to children to decide what they want to learn and have the teachers as guides only.

Before enrolling in this master's program, I worked for around 5 years as a software developer at <a href="https://www.md-systems.ch/en" target="_blank">MD Systems GmbH</a>, the top <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a> contributor in Switzerland.

I am an advocate of multidisciplinarity and collaboration. This allowed me to create my own initiatives related to mental health awareness, sustainability, music, video production, and game design. You can see all my previous projects <a href="/project">here</a>.

On the side, I focus on developing my <a href="/garden">digital garden</a> where I upload my own essays and notes.

## A Little History

I was born and raised in El Alto, Bolivia. I grew surrounded by mountains in a young city located at 4000 meters above the sea level.

I graduated with a bachelor's in Computer Systems Engineering at Del Valle University in La Paz, Bolivia and in 2014, I was awarded an exchange scholarship to Tokyo, Japan. This initial experience changed my way of looking at things and how I understood other cultures. I started learning Japanese and getting to teach English on campus.

By 2016, I got accepted as an intern in Switzerland and I moved to Zurich to work for 7 months. During that time, I found my passion for Open Source technologies and community building. This experience led me to connect with Drupal communities around the world and create bonds with other communities. After going back to Bolivia, I joined Nucleo GNU/Linux, a study group of free software. This community opened new worlds to me in order to support others to also work abroad with Open Source and Free technologies.

My passion for Sustainability was later enhanced when I was selected for the Young Sustainable Impact program in Norway. Among more than 8000 applicants, 24 people were selected. Meeting so many motivated individuals gave me a new perspective on life. I was sure I wanted to become an advocate for sustainable causes.

Ever since then, I started creating multiple projects to use all the skills I had learned. I co-founded organizations tackling mental health, sustainability, and gender equality issues. I volunteered in organizations as a videographer, photographer, HR manager, and Community manager. And created my own podcast and songs.

After living in 5 different countries, I am trying to find my place in Copenhagen, Denmark. I enjoy an active life.
